These are 10 projects that I have built using python to get better at it. 

The 10 Python applications are:

1. A program that returns English-word definitions

2. A program that blocks access to distracting websites 

3. A web map visualizing volcanoes and population data

4. A portfolio website

5. A desktop-graphical program with a database backend

6. A webcam motion detector

7. A web scraper of real estate data

8. An interactive web graph

9. A database web application

10. A web service that converts addresses to geographic coordinates
