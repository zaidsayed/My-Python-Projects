These are 10 projects that I have built using python to get better at it. 

The 10 Python applications are:

A program that returns English-word definitions

A program that blocks access to distracting websites 

A web map visualizing volcanoes and population data

A portfolio website

A desktop-graphical program with a database backend

A webcam motion detector

A web scraper of real estate data

An interactive web graph

A database web application

A web service that converts addresses to geographic coordinates
